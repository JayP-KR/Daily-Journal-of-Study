Got it, Jay! Thanks for the clarification. Here's the **updated and accurate Day 3 summary** reflecting your actual progress and topics covered:

---

**ðŸ§  Daily Learning Journal â€“ Day 3**  
**ðŸ“… Date:** 14/04/25  
**ðŸ“˜ Platform:** FreeCodeCamp  
**ðŸ“š Course/Topic:** JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures

---

### âœ… Progress:
- Continued the course from **Step 64 to 118**
- Completed:
    1. **Pyramid Generator** using loops and string methods
    2. **Gradebook App** â€“ all tasks completed successfully ðŸŽ“âœ…

### ðŸ’¡ What I Learned:

- **Loops & Nesting**
    - Practiced using nested `for` loops for creating patterns like pyramids.
    - Learned how to control spacing using string methods.

- **String Methods**
    - Used `.repeat()` to replicate characters.
    - Used `\n` to structure multi-line strings.

- **Functions & Parameters**
    - Created custom functions to handle logic for tasks like generating the pyramid.

- **Arrays**
    - Learned how to manipulate arrays using:
        - `.push()` â€“ Add to the end
        - `.pop()` â€“ Remove from the end
        - `.shift()` â€“ Remove from the beginning
        - `.unshift()` â€“ Add to the beginning

- **Conditional Logic**
    - Used `if/else` statements for grading logic inside the gradebook app.

### ðŸ¤” What I Struggled With:
- Minor alignment issues while building the pyramid pattern.
