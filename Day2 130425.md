**📚 Course/Topic:** JavaScript Practice – Problem Solving

### ✅ Progress:
- Solved my **first Codewars kata** in under 15 minutes.
- Cleared it on the **second attempt**—I missed checking case sensitivity the first time, even though it was mentioned that case shouldn't matter. But overall, I’m happy with the result. **Yay! 🎉**

- Also completed a kata using character counting logic.

---

### 💡 What I Learned:

- **Importance of Case Sensitivity** in string comparison.  
  👉 Lesson: Always read the problem statement carefully.

- **How to Count Duplicate Characters in a String**  
  👉 *Example:*
  ```javascript
  function duplicateCount(text){
      let string = text.toLowerCase();
      let count = 0;
      let obj = {};

      for (const char of string) {
          if (obj[char]) {
              obj[char]++;
          } else {
              obj[char] = 1;
          }

          if (obj[char] === 2) {
              count++;
          }
      }

      return count;
  }
  ```

- **Debugging Logic Errors** – Initially, I was trying to find the **maximum number of times** a character was duplicated, but the actual task was to **count how many characters appeared more than once**.

- **Asking for Help (Smartly)** – I reached out to ChatGPT to clarify my misunderstanding, and it helped me fix my logic and complete the kata.

---

### 🤔 What I Struggled With:
- Misinterpreting the problem – I thought the task was to find the most repeated character instead of the **number of distinct characters** that are repeated.
- Needed to better visualize what the loop was doing to the object and when to increment the count.

---

### ✍️ Notes for Tomorrow:
- Keep reading problem statements slowly and carefully.
- Maybe try another Codewars problem focused on array or string manipulation.
- Aim to solve a kata without external help tomorrow!
