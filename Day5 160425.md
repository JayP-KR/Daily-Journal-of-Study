The lecture introduces **software development**, defining it as the process of creating, designing, implementing, and maintaining software applications or systems. Key points include:

- **Understanding User Needs**: Developers start by identifying what clients or stakeholders require.
- **Types of Requirements**:
  - **Functional Requirements**: Specific features the software must have.
  - **Non-Functional Requirements**: Performance aspects like security and responsiveness.
  - **Technical Requirements**: Technology constraints guiding development choices.

- **Designing Solutions**: Developers conceptualize the architecture and break down projects into manageable components.
- **Coding**: Using programming languages (like Java), developers write code to implement functionality.
- **Testing and Debugging**: Ensuring the software works as intended by identifying and fixing issues.
- **Collaboration**: Software development is often a team effort, requiring effective communication.
- **Continuous Learning**: Staying updated with new technologies is essential for developers.
- **Version Control and Documentation**: Tools like Git help track changes, while documentation ensures code is understandable.

The lecture emphasizes that every developer starts as a beginner and encourages embracing challenges and continuous learning in the field.
